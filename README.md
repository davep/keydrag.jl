# keydrag.jl

`keydrag.jl` provides a number of functions for moving windows in the
Sawfish window manager. These functions can easily be bound to keys,
allowing you to move windows without the need to reach for a pointing
device. The package also contains a function that creates a default set of
keypad bindings.
